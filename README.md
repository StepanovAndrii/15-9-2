## Introduction

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project comes from a long-standing desire to help fitness beginners through software, as I am one myself. There are plenty of solutions online to suit every taste. But it's imposible to solve an individual’s problem with a one-size-fits-all application. That's the case for me too. Therefore, the key reasons why I considered creating an app in this case were:
- Personal control over the app's content
- All required functions are available in one place.
- Time savings (thanks to all-in-one functionality)
- Practical experience and a portfolio project for my CV

Thus, I started to evaluate possible functions for the software.

### 1. Calorie intake calculator

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic and most important foundation of the fitness industry is the calculation of calorie intake. As Michael Matthews puts it in Bigger Leaner Stronger book [[1]](#reference-1):

> Suppose you’re planning to drive across the country with a friend, and they say they want to do it without looking at the gas tank. They insist you should only stop to refuel when you feel like stopping, and only pump as much (or as little) gas as you feel like pumping.

With this hypothetical scenario, the author demonstrates why calorie control is a must. The human body is like a machine - if you don't fuel it properly and on time, you don't reach your destination (like getting the body you want). This is the first and most important step to take.
